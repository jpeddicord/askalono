## [0.4.3] - 2020-09-23

### Added

- Re-introduced gzip cache compression as an optional feature. The default is still zstd.
- `Store` gained `get_original` to fetch the canonical license text, instead of needing to access the text via a match.

### Changed

- Updated SPDX dataset

## [0.4.2] - 2020-01-14

- Performance improvements in text pre-processing ([#48], thanks [@AnthonyMikh])
- Updated SPDX dataset

## [0.4.1] - 2019-12-06

### Fixed

- Removed some extraneous files from the core `askalono` packaged crate.
- Include LICENSE, NOTICE, and README.md in `askalono-cli` crate.

[0.4.1]: https://github.com/jpeddicord/askalono/releases/tag/0.4.1

## [0.4.0] - 2019-11-06

### Added

- askalono will attempt to ignore license "title lines" (e.g. "The MIT License") that occasionally appear on licenses.

### Changed

- (Breaking) Switch to Rust 2018 edition.
- (Breaking) Drop the previously-deprecated `aliases` field. Aliases can instead be queried with the `aliases` function on a `Store`.
- (Breaking) `analyze` (on `Store`) no longer returns a Result. There was no reasonable case where it could fail.
- (Breaking) `with_view`, `white_out`, `optimize_bounds` on `TextData` also no longer return Result, as they never had an expected failure path outside of programming errors. A panic may occur if an out-of-bounds view is used -- this is intentional. See commit 8d11161c.
- Stores are now compressed with zstd instead of gzip, which provides better compression and performance particularly for the dataset used by askalono.
- Fresh SPDX dataset.
- URLs in licenses will be "black-boxed" in case modified/re-hosted.

### Fixed

- The `lcs_removal` preprocessor has been fixed to be less aggressive on certain repeated statements ([#42]).
- Fixed CLI help text strings ([#34])

[#34]: https://github.com/jpeddicord/askalono/issues/34

## [0.3.0] - 2018-09-27

### Added

- Scanning strategies have been added in `ScanStrategy`. These include some common high-level logic that can be used for diving deeper into askalono's results.
- `Store` gained methods to add your own licenses to its dataset at runtime. These are `add_license` and `add_variant`.
- `Store` lets you retrieve and set the list of aliases for a given license.
- `Store` can also tell you which licenses are present with `licenses`.
- `TextData`'s `with_view` is now public. It can be used to change the region of lines in a text you're interested in without needing to wholly re-compute data for the underlying string.
- `TextData` also learned `white_out`, which is the inverse of `with_view`. It erases the active view's lines. This can be useful when a match has been found and you'd like to "hide" it to perform further analysis.
- The command-line application learned how to output JSON for better machine parsing.
- EXPERIMENTAL: askalono is WebAssembly-capable. Loading caches is not yet supported due to missing upstream dependencies. This likely to be available in the near future.

### Changed

- `optimize_bounds` now returns a Result. Previously it would have paniced if `self` was missing text.

### Deprecated

- The `aliases` field has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Prefer looking up aliases in the store when needed.

### Fixed

- `optimize_bounds` now respects existing line views/windows on TextData structs.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/jpeddicord/askalono/releases/tag/0.3.0

## [0.2.0] - 2018-05-13

### Added

- Full documentation for the public API.
- The CLI can now read a list of filenames from stdin (batch mode).
- The CLI is capable of crawling a directory tree, looking for license-like files and identifying them.
- The library and CLI can now optimize a matched license to tell you _where_ in your source the match was identified.

### Changed

- Revised API. API changes are likely to be much more rare from here on out.
- Many performance improvements. `analyze` is now able to run in 3-5 ms on commodity hardware!
- Text storage and normalization improvements.
- Duplicate SPDX entries are now stored as aliases.
- SPDX definitions have been updated.

### Removed

- The "diff" option is now only available if compiled with the "diagnostics" feature (off by default). This was intended for debugging and had no practical use in the binary.

### Fixed

- Resolved a potential panic for short/empty license files (a divide-by-zero was involved).
